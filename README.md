#Harry Potter Kata 

My solution to the [Harry Potter Kata](https://github.com/nspectator/katas/tree/master/list/HarryPotter) using Java 8 with Gradle.

To execute the tests:

```./gradlew test```

Or run them in your IDE

Look at BookStoreTest test class to understand the solution. There is a Book class, Promotion class, and ShoppingBasket class.  The BookStore test class implements these, creating instances of books and promotions and then adding books to the ShoppingBasket, applying promotions and asserting the results.
